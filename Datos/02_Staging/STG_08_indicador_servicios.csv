"24","Warnings/Notes","Since 2008 the publication has been enhanced to include enterprises based on PAYE employers that are not also registered for VAT, extending the scope from the previous VAT based enterprise publication. This is a major change to the scope of the publication. The increase in units is most noticeable in the VAT-exempt industries of finance (J), education (M), health
(N) and public administration (L, O and Q)."
